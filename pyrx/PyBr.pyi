        Returns a pointer to the AcRxClass object representing the specific class, or most recent
        parent class explicitly registered with ObjectARX of either the pointer type used to invoke
        it or the class qualifier used with it. (Remember that when a static member function is
        invoked via a pointer, the pointer type, not the object type, determines which
        implementation of the function is invoked.) When working with a pointer to an object and
        the proper AcRxClass object for the class of the object pointed to is desired, the
        AcRxObject::isA() function should be used, since it is a virtual non-static method and is
        therefore not pointer type dependent. Caching the value of the pointer returned by this
        method is acceptable, provided the application knows that the AcRxClass object pointed to
        by the returned pointer was created by an ObjectARX application that will not be unloaded.
