        Gets user input for a point. The AutoCAD user can specify the point by entering a
        coordinate in the current units format; acedGetPoint() treats pt and result as
        three-dimensional points. The user can specify the point also by specifying a location on
        the graphics screen. If the pt argument is not null, AutoCAD draws a rubber-band line from
        pt to the current crosshair position. The coordinates of the point stored in result are
        expressed in terms of the current UCS. The user cannot respond to acedGetPoint() by
        entering an AutoLISP expression. The acedGetPoint() function returns one of the following:
        RTNORM if it succeeds, RTERROR if it fails, or RTCAN if the user cancels the request (by
        pressing [Esc]). It returns RTMODELESS, if the active command was registered using the
        ACRX_CMD_INTERRUPTIBLE flag and the document has received a modeless interrupt signal from
        a call to  AcApDocManager::sendModelessInterrupt(). A prior call to acedInitGet() can also
        enable return values of RTNONE or RTKWORD.
